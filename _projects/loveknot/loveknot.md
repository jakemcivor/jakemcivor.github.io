This was my first 3D printed part that I designed from scratch. I modified a friendship/love knot that I had modeled in Blender for a previous project to make a more pronounced heart shape on the top loop.

The finished model was exported as a .stl file and then sliced using the Tinkerine Suite software. The downside of the heart shape is that support is necessary to support the top loop.

The model was printed at the <a href="http://vanhack.ca">Vancouver Hack Space</a> using the Tinkerine Ditto Pro.
