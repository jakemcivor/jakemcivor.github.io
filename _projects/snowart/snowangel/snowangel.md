This was my first "real" snow sculpture and it involved a lot of learning and trial and error throughout the process.

I began by creating a huge pile of snow with help of our snowblower and a fair amount of shoveling. The pile was left to harden up overnight.

For the design, I found and printed out some pictures of angels for inspiration. The design evolved as I went and finished the various details. Thankfully, snow is pretty forgiving and it is possible to patch parts where too much material is taken away.

The sculpture was finished with a color to make the details pop through.

The nature of the medium is very much non-permanent. Within a few days, warmer weather and sunshine caused the angel to fall.
