This was my first "real" snow sculpture and it involved a lot of learning and trial and error throughout the process.

I began by creating a huge pile of snow with help of our snowblower and a fair amount of shoveling. The pile was left to harden up overnight.

For the design, I found and printed out some pictures of angels for inspiration.
