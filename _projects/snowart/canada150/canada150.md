To help kick-off Canada's 150th birthday year, myself and several friends made a snow sculpture.

I directed and finalized the design, featuring a maple leaf birthday cake topped off with a beaver, candles, and mountains.

The idea for the candle flames game from my mom and consisted of freezing food-coloured water in cookie sheets and cake molds. 

The process spanned about three days from initial piling to final colouring.
