To make this snow sculpture, I used a snowblower to help form a large pile of snow. After letting it harden up for a few days, the shape was roughed out using shovels and other garden tools.

After considering a variety of ideas, the BB8 droid, from the recently released Star Wars movie, was selected since the relatively straightforward shape fit well with my timeline. My friend Erik helped with a lot of the rough shaping and snow moving.

Achieving the right shape and proportions was challenging at this scale, so frequent pauses were used to step back and reassess the shape.

A simple string compass was used to help mark the final details of the round elements. The final touch was to add some color and details using spraypaint.

As an added touch, the various chunks of waste snow were used to form a trail in the yard to make it appear as though the droid had rolled up from the alley to the left.
