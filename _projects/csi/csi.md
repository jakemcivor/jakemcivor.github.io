I am part of the Community Scientist Initiative at <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca">Telus World of Science</a> and volunteer semi-regularly during Meet A Scientist weekends.

My activity is based around human bracing, or how body positioning can affect performance. I lead a simple writing experiment that demonstrated the effect of human bracing, and relate that to how bracing can be used to improve other tasks, like playing the boardgame Operation.
