I had the opportunity to work with a multi-disciplinary team to develop a product aimed at solving an issue in healthcare. After a few false starts, we pivoted and pursued a system that would make it easier for a blind parent to navigate with a stroller.

Over the course of a weekend, our team developed a prototype system that used ultrasonic range detection sensors to detect obstacles and drop-offs and vibratory motors to provide feedback to the user.

After presenting and demoing our solution to a panel of industry judges, we were awarded the Doctors of BC Collaboration award.
