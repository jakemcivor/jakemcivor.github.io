I took part in the 2017 Access Makeathon put on by the <a href="https://www.neilsquire.ca">Neil Squire Society</a> to develop an open source assistive technology. 

Our team leader / client Jarrod has multiple sclerosis and difficulty speaking. He is legally blind and has limited motion below the neck, so he typically has to rely on a friend or caregiver to read letters out loud and raise his eyebrows to make selection. Despite only being able to communicate at 2-3 words per minute, Jarrod has managed to write a biography over the past 10 years using this method.

Our team's project was to develop a solution to help Jarrod communicate independently.

As part of their final year capstone project, a group of electrical engineering students at UBC had been working with Jarrod for several months to address the same challenge using a gaze tracking sensor.  After discussing the capstone team's challenge with the gaze sensor, our team decided to investigate other input options, and develop sensors that would work in a stand-alone system as well as integrate with the capstone project software.

Over the course of the weekend, our team developed a simple augementative and assistive communication device. audio-based keyboard and text-to-speech system.  utilizing an infrared blink detection sensor.
