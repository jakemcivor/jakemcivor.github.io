tasks:
 - Brainstormed and tested various methods to apply bracing to arm
 - Developed numerical model to simulate human arm motion using Matlab
 - Used Solidworks to develop research apparatus
 - Wrote ethics application and received clearance for human behaviour study
 - Developed real-time visual feedback and data acquistion system using LabVIEW
 - Developed method to quantify drill plunge during simulated surgical drilling
 - Applied linear mixed model statistics using R
 - Drafted thesis using LaTeX

My master's work at UBC involved investigating how human bracing may be used to improve surgical tasks like surgical drilling.
