Worked with a multi-disciplinary team to develop a product aimed at making it easier for bind parents to navigate with a stroller. 

Our system used ultrasonic range detection sensors to detect obstacles and drop-offs and vibratory motors to provide feedback to the user.

We won the Doctors of BC collaboration award.
