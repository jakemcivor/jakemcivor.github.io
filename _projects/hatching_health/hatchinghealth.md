I had the opportunity to work with a multi-disciplinary team to develop a product aimed at solving an issue in healthcare. Our team pursued a system that would make it easier for a blind parent to navigate with a stroller. 

Over the course of a weekend, our team developed a prototype system that used ultrasonic range detection sensors to detect obstacles and drop-offs and vibratory motors to provide feedback to the user.

We won the Doctors of BC collaboration award.
