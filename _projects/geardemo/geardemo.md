A class demonstration device for demonstarting the geometry and movement of involute gears. The device is designed to be placed upon an overhead projector. The instructor can use dry erase markers to trace the geometry and show the contact between teeth. The distance between the gears is adjustable.

My involvement in this project:
 - Design and detailing in Pro/E
 - Sourcing and ordering parts
 - Overseeing machining
 - Assistance with assembly
